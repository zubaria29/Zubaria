					<h2>A Formal Approach for the Verification of AWS IAM Access Control Policies</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Ehtesham Zahoor<sup>1</sup>, Zubaria Asma<sup>1</sup>, and Olivier Perrin<sup>2</sup>: “A Formal Approach for the
Verification of AWS IAM Access Control Policies”. ESOCC 2017: (59-74)<br> URL: http://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/a/Asma:Zubaria</p>
					<p>One of the major challenges in Cloud Computing adoption is security and in this paper we address
one important security aspect, the Cloud authorization. We have provided a formal Attribute
Based Access Control (ABAC) model, that is based on Event-Calculus and is able to model and
verify AWS IAM policies. The proposed approach is expressive and extensible. We have
provided generic event-calculus modes and provided tool support to automatically convert JSON
based IAM policies in event-calculus. We have also presented performance evaluation results on
actual IAM policies to justify the scalability and practicality of the approach.</p>
